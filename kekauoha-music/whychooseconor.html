            <h2>Always More to Learn</h2>
            <p>
                Conor firmly believes that you can never stop learning and that you are never too good to not need a 
                teacher - there is always more to learn.  To that end, he continues to take lessons of his own to further 
                his playing ability, refine his technique, and to become a better teacher.

            <h2>Fun and Productive</h2>
            <p>
                Sometimes teachers are too hard on their students, creating an environment of strict, stern discipline 
                - without room for error.  While others are too kind and lenient, leading the student to behave as if it 
                were a playdate or hang out.  However, as mentioned on the “What I Teach” page, Conor exhibits the needed 
                patience and kindness, complemented with the necessary discipline. Doing this, Conor maintains a proper 
                teacher/student relationship while also keeping lessons fun and productive.

            <h2>Interactive Worksheets</h2>
            <p>
                To keep lessons fun, Conor uses outside resources that are pertinent to the current season or holiday 
                and brings musical pieces and/or theory worksheets which reflect that!  For example, during October he 
                brings theory worksheets that have pumpkins and Fall qualities on them and pieces that are spooky and 
                fun to remind you of Halloween!

        <section class="platforms-msg">
            <h2>Mulitple Platforms</h2>
            <p>
                Another reason to seriously consider Conor as you or your child's teacher, is he can teach through a 
                variety of avenues. As with most people, Conor realized during the Covid pandemic how important and 
                necessary adapting to teaching via zoom or skype is.  So, if you are out of the area, feel more 
                comfortable at home, or want the ease of just logging in, then Conor is more than happy to accommodate 
                that need and teach you over the screen!  For those who are nearby and would like Conor to come to them, 
                he is more than capable and willing. And for those who want to come to him, that is completely acceptable 
                as well.
