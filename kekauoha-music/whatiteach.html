                        If you are a beginner guitar player, Conor is the guy to get you started.  He tailors the lessons towards how 
                        and what you want to play.  While also focusing on the basics of guitar playing, such as: fretboard knowledge, 
                        picking/playing styles, and correct form/technique. For those who want to get over that infamous intermediate 
                        plateau, Conor can help with that. From learning to comfortably navigate the fretboard, to expanding your music 
                        theory knowledge. Both of which are essential to mastering the guitar.

                    <p>
                        Playing the Ukulele is way easier than it may look!  Not only does it have less strings than a Guitar, 
                        but it is smaller too! Conor can help you get started by guiding you through learning basic chords, 
                        more advance chord shapes, and strumming/picking patterns.
