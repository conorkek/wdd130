      <h3>What I Teach</h3>
      <p>
        Conor has been playing and involved with music since he was 7-year-old and has loved most every moment 
        of it! He plays a wide range of styles, ranging from: Classical and Ragtime pieces to Pop and Original 
        Soundtrack music.  He has been teaching for 10+ years and has taught a wide variety of students ranging 
        from ages 5 to older than 40!  He has the patience and kindness needed to guide young children with their 
        musical journey.  He also has the depth of knowledge and experience to bring those who feel stuck to the 
        next level in their playing ability.
        <br><br>
        Piano
        <br><br>If you are a beginner or intermediate piano player Conor can help take your playing to the next level.  
        For beginner students (mainly young children), he uses a unique teaching style that focuses on developing 
        inner ear balance along with creating a firm foundation for reading musical notation and establish proper 
        technique.  For intermediate players, he assesses where you are and what your playing goals are and helps you 
        achieve them!
        <br><br>
        Violin
        <br><br>
        Conor can help beginner violin players focus on the fundamentals of violin playing.  He uses the Violin Suzuki 
        Method with a mix of pieces from current or modern music to keep playing fun and interesting for each student. 
        While keeping lessons fun, he also focuses on developing proper and lasting technique.
        <br><br>
        Guitar
        <br><br>
        If you are a beginner guitar player, Conor is the guy to get you started.  He tailors the lessons towards how 
        and what you want to play.  While also focusing on the basics of guitar playing, such as: fretboard knowledge, 
        picking/playing styles, and correct form/technique. For those who want to get over that infamous intermediate 
        plateau, Conor can help with that. From learning to comfortably navigate the fretboard, to expanding your music 
        theory knowledge. Both of which are essential to mastering the guitar.
        <br><br>
        Ukulele
        <br><br>
        Playing the Ukulele is way easier than it may look!  Not only does it have less strings than a Guitar, 
        but it is smaller too! Conor can help you get started by guiding you through learning basic chords, 
        more advance chord shapes, and strumming/picking patterns.

      <h3>Why Choose Conor?</h3>
      <p>
        Conor firmly believes that you can never stop learning and that you are never too good to not need a 
        teacher - there is always more to learn.  To that end, he continues to take lessons of his own to further 
        his playing ability, refine his technique, and to become a better teacher. 
        <br><br>
        Sometimes teachers are too hard on their students, creating an environment of strict, stern discipline 
        - without room for error.  While others are too kind and lenient, leading the student to behave as if it 
        were a playdate or hang out.  However, as mentioned on the “What I Teach” page, Conor exhibits the needed 
        patience and kindness, complemented with the necessary discipline. Doing this, Conor maintains a proper 
        teacher/student relationship while also keeping lessons fun and educational.
        <br><br>
        To keep lessons fun, Conor uses outside resources that are pertinent to the current season or holiday 
        and brings musical pieces and/or theory worksheets which reflect that!  For example, during October he 
        brings theory worksheets that have pumpkins and Fall qualities on them and pieces that are spooky and 
        fun to remind you of Halloween!
        <br><br>
        Another reason to seriously consider Conor as you or your child's teacher, is he can teach through a 
        variety of avenues. As with most people, Conor realized during the Covid pandemic how important and 
        necessary adapting to teaching via zoom or skype is.  So, if you are out of the area, feel more 
        comfortable, or want the ease of just logging in, then Conor is more than happy to accommodate that need 
        and teach you over the screen!  For those who are nearby and would like Conor to come to them, he is 
        more than capable and willing. And for those who want to come to him, that is completely acceptable as 
        well.
